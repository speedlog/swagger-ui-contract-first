# Run REST API from swagger-ui

We can found many examples, where swagger-ui is available, when we add to project "springfox-swagger2" library.
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.springfox</groupId>
    <artifactId>springfox-swagger2</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.2</version>
</dependency>
```

We shouldn't use this library, when we already have a file that contains contract (contract first approach).
Why?  
1. This library generate contract based on Controller and use it in swagger-ui. Generated contract will not have the same information that in our contract file.
2. It contains an old version of swagger-ui.

Solution?  
Use swagger-ui from webjar.  
Add also "webjars-locator" library to automatic resolve version of swagger-ui.  

Requirements:
- java 11

Run application
```
./gradlew bootRun
```
and see [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

More details
- OpenAPI contract is in file [src/main/resources/contract/some-test-API.v1.yaml](src/main/resources/contract/some-test-API.v1.yaml).
- This file is available in url [http://localhost:8080/contract/some-test-API.v1.yaml](http://localhost:8080/contract/some-test-API.v1.yaml).
- Configuration to load webjar is in [SwaggerWebjarConfiguration](src/main/java/pl/speedlog/example/swaggerui/controller/SwaggerWebjarConfiguration.java).  
Swagger-ui is available only in `dev` profile.
- Configuration contains also a redirect. When we run [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), application redirect us to [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html?url=/contract/some-test-API.v1.yaml](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html?url=/contract/some-test-API.v1.yaml).  
This may be very handy, when our application is only backend.  
- Java classes for this API is generated by `org.openapi.generator` plugin. See configuration [openapi-generator.gradle](openapi-generator.gradle).
